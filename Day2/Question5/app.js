// Question 6: Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.
