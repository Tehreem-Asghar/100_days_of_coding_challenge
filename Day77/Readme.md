# SSL vs TLS vs SSH Protocols

* SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): is a protocol designed to secure communications over the internet by encrypting data between a server and a client. While SSL has been largely replaced by the more secure TLS (Transport Layer Security), it played a crucial role in the development of secure internet communications. SSL ensures data privacy, authentication, and integrity, making it a fundamental technology for protecting sensitive information online.

* TLS (Transport Layer Security): is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between communicating applications over a network. It is an evolution of SSL, offering stronger encryption and improved security. TLS is widely used to secure web browsing, email, VoIP, and instant messaging, ensuring that data transmitted over the internet remains confidential and intact.

* SSH (Secure Shell): is a protocol designed for secure remote access and management of network devices and servers. It provides strong encryption and authentication to ensure data privacy and integrity. SSH is widely used for secure remote login, command execution, and file transfers, making it an essential tool for system administrators and users requiring secure network communications.
