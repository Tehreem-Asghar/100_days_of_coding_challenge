Day-81 Task:

So far, we've covered almost every main topic in JavaScript and TypeScript. We also fundamentally understand the most important things we may do in programming and in general. Now, it's time to move on to learning about React.js and Next.js through a simple, step-by-step guide by building a project, and learning alot of great things.

Today's task is to learn about:

* React Foundation https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations
* About React and Next.js https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs
* Rendering User Interfaces (UI) https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/rendering-ui
