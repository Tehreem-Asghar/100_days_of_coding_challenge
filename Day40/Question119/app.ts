// Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.

// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains
//true. Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.


let logs = 1;
// this loop will print five times 'hello world.'
while (logs <= 5) {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
  logs++;
}
