// Question 139: List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use
// case for each.
// Explain & TIP: Reserved words in JavaScript are words that have a special
//meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). Understanding these can help prevent syntax errors and make your code more readable.
var reserve_word_let = 'Reserved word "let" : The let keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a block-scoped variable.';
console.log(reserve_word_let);
var Reserved_word_const = 'Reserved word "const" : The const keyword is used to declare a constant variable whose value cannot be changed once initialized';
console.log(Reserved_word_const);
if (10 > 0) {
    console.log('Reserved word "if" : used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true');
}
