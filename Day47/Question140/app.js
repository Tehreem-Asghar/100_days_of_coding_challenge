// Question 140: Explain the error that occurs when trying to use a reserved word
// as a variable name.
// Explain & TIP: Attempting to use a reserved word as a variable name will cause
// a syntax error in JavaScript. This is because reserved words have predefined
// meanings and uses in the language syntax.
// Attempting to use a reserved word as a variable name
//let let = "Tehreem"; // This line would cause a syntax error
console.log("let is reserved key word so that's why  \"let\" is not allowed to be used as a name causes a syntax error in JavaScript.");
// It's important to avoid using reserved words as identifiers to prevent these errors.
