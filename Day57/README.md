Comparisons in JavaScript :https://javascript.info/comparison

Conditional Operators: if, '?'(Ternary Operator) in JavaScript : https://javascript.info/ifelse

In this Articales I learn about comparison operator  & conditional operators

COMPARISON OPERATOR: 
comparison operators are fundamental tools in programming for making decisions, organizing data, and controlling the flow of execution in a program.
* Comparison operators return a boolean value.
* when we compared string text so that case Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.
* When values of different types are compared, they get converted to numbers (with the exclusion of a strict equality check).
* A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.

CONDITIONAL OPERATORS:
Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.
To do that, we can use the if statement and the conditional operator ?, that’s also called a “question mark” operator.
