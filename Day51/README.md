you've to read the following Article and understand everything else in it.

Why should you completely read it?

Many students ask that how to build logic in programming, how to understand the things, etc. so this article is the answer of most of your questions in simple words.


🔰 TOPIC : 𝑻𝒐𝒑 10 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑻𝒊𝒑𝒔 𝑭𝒐𝒓 𝑩𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒓𝒔👀 

 🛡 1-Practice Must Important in Programing : 

Most of the students only watch tutorials on YouTube and attend classes and think in the way they understood everything, and they don't need to practice This is one of the worst mistakes beginners always make in programming.

📌 Example:  you can't speak good English by memorizing grammar formulas without practice. the same thing happens in coding. Practice not only helps in reinforcing theoretical knowledge but also hones problem-solving skills and enhances proficiency in programming languages.

🛡 2- Don’t Leave a Gap in Your Learning:

Consistency is also most important in programing. Consistency is key to mastering any skill, especially in programming. If we take gap in programming, we will forget the concept.

📌 Example: like I'm student if I will gap own study so many concept I will forget similar is here.

🛡 3. Don’t do Over Analysis of the Concept

most of students in starting study very deeply Analyzing a concept in-depth for the first time is not good, because this will end up with nothing but confusion. once you have enough experience you can go in-depth for the specific concept.

🛡 4. Read The Error Message Carefully

many Bigner students don't read errors and immediately ask from own seniors or mentors. so, student should read errors carefully. because most of the solution to fix the error are in the error message.

🛡 5. Solve the MCQs Questions in Programming

As soon as you learn a new concept, search for questions on Google related to that concept and solve them. This practice will not only deepen your understanding but also prepare you for campus interviews and off-campus opportunities

🛡 6. Code With Hands 

If you have done coding with your hands, then it will provide you with a deeper understanding of the logic and structure of the code.

🛡 7. Read Other People’s Code

When you read other people's code, this allows you to find solutions to problems.

🛡 8. Enhance Your Problem-Solving Skills

In coding the more you will think on any problem, the less response time your brain will take because when you take time while solving a problem it will boost your problem-solving skills.

🛡 9. Divide Things into Smaller Parts

Divide time into parts and then work according to the time allocated for each task.

🛡 10. Find a Perfect Mentor

find good mentor for guide you better.
